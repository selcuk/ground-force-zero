This is the BASIC source code of the ZX Spectrum game Ground Force Zero by Titan Programs, 1982.
Extracted from the `.tzx` file using [`tzxcat`](https://shredzone.org/docs/tzxtools/tzxcat/).

It's a clone of Commodore VIC-20 game [Blitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blitz_(video_game)),
which itself is based on the Atari game [Canyon Bomber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canyon_Bomber).
